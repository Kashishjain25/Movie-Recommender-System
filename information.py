        based on a comparison between the content of the items and a user profile.For instance, if a user
        likes to watch movies such as Iron Man, the recommender system recommends movies of the superhero
        genre or films describing Tony Stark.The central assumption of content-based filtering is that you 
        will also like a similar item if you like a particular item*.""")
